# A Momentous Occasion

**Points: 2**

## Summary
Congratulations! You are about to become the first human to land on the surface of Mars! Tou will need to work out one important detail before landing: exactly how much thrust (or force) will be required for your spacecraft to slow down. In order to answer that question, first you'll need to know your spacecraft's momentum.

In physics, Momentum is the product of the mass and velocity of an object. Mathematically speaking, it is also the same as the product of force and time. Newton's second law states that the change in an object's momentum is proportional to the force applied to that object. For example, a massive quickly moving spacecraft has a large momentum and it would take a large (or prolonged) force to accelerate the spacecraft to that speed. In the same way, it would take a large (or prolonged) force to stop the spacecraft's motion. If the spacecraft were lighter or moving more slowly, then the amount of force required for those actions would also be smaller.

Mathematically, the momentum `p` is calculated by multiplying the mass `m` and the velocity `v`.

```
p = m * v
```

Write a program to calculate the momentum of a spacecraft given it's mass and velocity.

## Input
The input consists of two positive integer values: the mass and velocity of a spacecraft. The maximum of either value is 16384.  
```
14392 9334
```

## Output
The program must print the momentum of the spacecraft.  
```
134334928
```
